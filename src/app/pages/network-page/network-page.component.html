        The Erasmus Student Network Germany, a non-profit student organisation,
        is the consolidation of German student organisations which take care of
        Erasmus and international students during their exchange in Germany. Our
        voluntary members, mostly students, take care of approximately 10,600
        exchange students every year in around 40 sections all over Germany.
        Next to all the sections, ESN Germany consists of other important
        bodies, which we will present to you below.

          ESN Germany is formed by the National Board. Its purpose is to support
          the local sections in all kinds of topics, to represent them in the
          international level between them and ESN International, and to
          strengthen the German network plus the relationships between the
          sections and their members. Each board member of ESN Germany is
          elected for a mandate of one year by the sections and works on a
          volunteer basis. The mandate starts on the 1st of April and the
          elections are usually held at the end of January, which gives a time
          frame of almost 2 months where predecessor and successor can work
          closely together to hand over all important tasks and transfer the
          knowledge.<br />
          The National Board consists of 10 positions which are always paired by
          their field of work.

        The Erasmus Student Network is one of the largest student associations
        in Europe, being present in more than 1000 Higher Education Institutions
        from 42 countries and functions as an umbrella organisation for many
        local and national organisations across the continent. The Headquarters
        are based in Brussels close to the European Parliament and other
        important partners and stakeholders of the organisation. Led by the
        International Board, ESN International has a high impact on mobility
        programmes in the European Higher Education area, most notably the
        Erasmus+ programme. ESN collaborates with very important stakeholders
        and policymakers in this area, such as the European Commission, the
        European University Foundation (EUF) and the European Studentâ€™s Union
        (ESU).
        <br />
        ESN works for the creation of a more mobile and flexible education
        environment by supporting and developing the student exchange from
        different levels and providing an intercultural experience also to those
        students who cannot access a period abroad ("internationalisation at
        home").

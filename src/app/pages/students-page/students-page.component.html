      ESN Germany relies on the action of its 40 local associations or so called
      “sections”, operating at the campus, university or city level, that
      directly work with the incoming students. Our local associations welcome,
      support and enrich the stay of international students through various
      actions (social, cultural, sport activities, welcome days, on-arrival
      support, Café Lingua, SocialErasmus, Erasmus In Schools, parties, etc.) to
      improve their social and practical integration.

      In addition to that, many sections introduce mentor or buddy systems to
      help and guide mainly in their academic and official activities. Local
      associations also deal with the reintegration of homecoming students and
      support them to use their freshly gained experiences and to keep contact
      with the international environment. Our local associations are very
      diverse in size and activity level. Most of them actively take part in the
      life of our network through the various statutory events for example our
      National Assemblies or Local Platforms. They often work in good
      collaboration with their hosting Higher Education Institutions.

            Mens sana in corpore sano. Moving abroad for an exchange is a big
            turnaround which includes changing our everyday habits. Regular
            practices usually happen when we have a stable routine, and it’s
            kind of hard to plan anything when you are aware that you will have
            to change your lifestyle again in 6 months or so.

            ESN implements the field of social inclusion by widening the
            participation and social engagement. ESN believes in a more diverse
            Erasmus+ programme, which is why our members work hard to raise
            awareness about mobility opportunities for students from
            underrepresented groups.

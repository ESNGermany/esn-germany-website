  The ESNcard is the membership card of the Erasmus Student Network! It is the

  in the network itself. It also serves as a discount card which gives you
  access to services and discounts all over Europe as well as online. To get an
  ESNcard, contact your closest ESN section. To find out more about discounts,
  check out our partners. You will find more information on how to register your

  ESN Germany advocates for students on international mobilities, incoming as
  well as outgoing, with a focus on the Erasmus+ Programme. We represent their
  needs and rights on the local, national and international level. Furthermore,
  we advocate for social inclusion and accessible international mobility
  programmes for every person, regardless of their background.
  <br />
  We are constantly looking for new institutional cooperations with
  organisations that have similar goals and aims. If your organisation would
  like to work with us, send us an email at

  and we can talk about possibilities for joint projects or general cooperation
  opportunities!
